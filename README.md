> Transform Claude Code into a self-improving senior developer with just one file.

## ✨ What is Claude Code OS?

Claude Code OS is a behavioral conditioning system that transforms Claude Code into a consistent, intelligent senior developer. It's not just a tool—it's an **operating system for AI-assisted development**.

### 🚀 Features

- **🧪 Self-Improving**: Learns from usage patterns across thousands of developers
- **📚 Persistent Memory**: Maintains project context and decisions
- **🚦 Quality Gates**: Automatic security, performance, and quality checks
- **👥 Team Sync**: Share patterns and knowledge across your team
- **⚡ Zero Config**: Works instantly with just one file

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Option 1: One-Line Install (Recommended)
```bash
curl -sSL https://claude.dev/os | bash
```

### Option 2: Manual Install
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaste/claude-code-os/main/CLAUDE.md > CLAUDE.md
```

### Option 3: Clone Template
```bash
gh repo create my-project --template zaste/claude-code-os
```

## 🎨 How It Works

1. **Drop `CLAUDE.md` in your project root**
   - Claude automatically reads and activates behavioral protocols
   - Zero configuration needed

2. **Claude becomes a senior developer**
   - Structured thinking before every response
   - Quality gates for all code
   - Consistent patterns and practices

3. **Progressive Enhancement** (optional)
   - Create `.claude/` folder for advanced features
   - Add custom commands and workflows
   - Enable team synchronization

## 📖 Example Usage

```bash
# After installing CLAUDE.md
$ claude "refactor this function for better performance"

# Claude now:
# 1. Analyzes current implementation
# 2. Identifies performance bottlenecks
# 3. Proposes multiple solutions
# 4. Implements with benchmarks
# 5. Validates security and quality
```

## 🧪 Progressive Enhancement

Start simple, grow powerful:

### Level 1: Basic (just CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Senior developer behavior
- ✅ Quality gates
- ✅ Best practices

### Level 2: Advanced (.claude/ folder)
- ✅ Custom commands
- ✅ Project memory
- ✅ Team protocols

### Level 3: Team (shared configuration)
- ✅ Synchronized patterns
- ✅ Shared knowledge base
- ✅ Consistent decisions

## 🛠️ Framework-Specific Templates

- 🔷 [React/Next.js](templates/react/)
- 🐍 [Python/Django/FastAPI](templates/python/)
- 🔷 [Go](templates/go/)
- 🟩 [Node.js/Express](templates/node/)
- 🦀 [Rust](templates/rust/)
